select case
    when id % 2 = 1 and id = (select COUNT(*) from Seat) then id
    when id % 2 = 0 then id - 1
    else id + 1
    END as id,
student from Seat
order by id

# Intuition : 
If the id is even, the student should move to the seat of id-1. If it is odd, they should move to id+1, unless it's the last id (in which case, they stay in their current seat because there's no seat with id+1).

# Question :
Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

# Example 1:
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Explanation: 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
